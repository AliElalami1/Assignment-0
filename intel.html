<nav>This website is brought to you by Ali Elalami.</nav>
<h2><b> Step 1: </b></h2>
<h3><b> You would try to locate the apporpiate site to purchase from. </b></h3>
<h3><b> I would try searching up youtube videos to see which broom is most efficient.</b></h3>
<h2><b> Which video I would recomend: </b></h2>
<h3> For me personally I think the video made by toilet lounge deffinetly gives a simple and good breakdown for those who arent sure on what to purchase.

<h2><b> For thoes who prefer to look for other videos if mine does not do the trick: </b>

<h3><b> You want to make sure that the video you watch is highly like and has good comments on it to ensure it is a trust worthy source.</b></h3>
<h3><b>Make sure you find a good broom for the price, you want to make sure the broom is highly capable of cleaning up a mess for example bread crumbs.</b></h3>
<h2> Step 3: </h2>
<h3> Once you have done the research and found the broom in your budget you will make the purchase.</h3>
<h2>What I personally recomend:</h2>
<h3>I would recomend a broom with either hard or soft bristles nothing inbetween because both are good for cleaning big messes. Something in the middle between soft and hard wont get the job done.</h3>

<h2> Alternative:
<h3> For those who prefer shopping in real life I recomend going up to a sales associate to recomend you a broom.</h3>
<h4> I hope that this source was useful to you guys in any way, but anyway have an amazing day! </h4>
